# texture-segmentation
Texture segmentation using the factorisation algorithms, which consists of multiple matrix decomposition techniques.
Filters like Laplacian of Gaussian filter and Gabor filter are used to generate an image model, from the distribution of which texture descriptors are generated in the form of spectral histograms, which are computed by finding the integral histograms for each pixel, and which are used as representative features for the model. Following this, factorisation is used to segment the image into parts, using methods such as low-rank approximation, singular value decomposition, and a non-negativity constraint. The algorithm has been implemented using python. The application selected for this project is analysis of aerial imagery. The code has been implemented on some aerial images and the outputs produced are very efficient and clear, allowing for a comprehensible understanding of the image, due to the clarity of the segments.
